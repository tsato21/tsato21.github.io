  <strong>Authorization</strong>: The first time you run the script, it will ask
  for your permission to access certain data. If you're using a free Gmail
  account, you might see a warning that says
  <code class="text-sm p-1 bg-gray-200 rounded text-gray-800">Not Verified by Google</code>. Don't worry about this warning - you still need to give permission for the
  script to work. The script is yours alone, and it won't share any data outside
  of Google, unless you choose to share your Google Sheet. The only data it
  might send outside of Google is website status codes, for monitoring purposes.
